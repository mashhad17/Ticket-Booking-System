# Ticket Booking System

## Overview
I have developed the **Ticket Booking System** to simplify the process of booking tickets for events. This system provides functionality for users to book tickets and for administrators to manage attendance. The system uses a hardcoded username and password for admin access.

## Features

### User Functionality
1. **Event Ticket Booking**
   - Users can view available events.
   - Users can book tickets for events.
   - A confirmation message is displayed after successful booking.

### Admin Functionality
1. **Login System**
   - Admin access is restricted with a hardcoded username and password.

2. **Attendance Management**
   - Admins can mark attendance for ticket holders.
   - Admins can view a list of attendees for each event.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: [Specify frontend technology, e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React]
- **Backend**: [Specify backend technology, e.g., Node.js, Django, Flask]
- **Database**: [Specify database, e.g., MySQL, SQLite]

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ticket-booking-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ticket-booking-system
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   [Specify installation command, e.g., npm install or pip install -r requirements.txt]
   ```
4. Set up the database:
   - Create a database and update the configuration file with your database credentials.
   - Run database migrations:
     ```bash
     [Specify migration command, e.g., python manage.py migrate]
     ```

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   [Specify command to start the server, e.g., npm start or python manage.py runserver]
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:[port]
   ```

## Usage
### For Users:
1. Browse available events.
2. Select an event and book tickets.
3. Receive confirmation upon successful booking.

### For Admins:
1. Log in using the hardcoded credentials.
   - **Username**: `admin`
   - **Password**: `password`
2. View a list of ticket holders.
3. Mark attendance for events.

## Future Enhancements
- Dynamic admin credentials with a secure authentication system.
- Integration of online payment for ticket booking.
- Enhanced user dashboard to manage bookings.
